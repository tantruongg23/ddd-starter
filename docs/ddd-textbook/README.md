## 📖 About Domain-Driven Design

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach introduced by Eric Evans in his 2003 book "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software." It provides:

- **A philosophy** for approaching complex software projects
- **A set of patterns** for modeling business domains
- **A language** for discussing software design with domain experts
- **Architectural guidance** for structuring large systems

DDD is not a framework or technology—it's a way of thinking about software that puts the business domain at the center of development efforts.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

Before diving deep into DDD, ensure you have:

- [ ] Basic understanding of Object-Oriented Programming
- [ ] Familiarity with at least one programming language (examples use Java)
- [ ] Understanding of basic software architecture concepts
- [ ] Some experience with database design and persistence
